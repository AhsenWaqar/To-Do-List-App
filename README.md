# To-Do-List-App
Web App using  HTML, CSS, JS
Overview
The Interactive To-Do List application is a web-based tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. This project serves as a practical exercise in web development, allowing students to apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and user-friendly application. The To-Do List application enables users to add, complete, and delete tasks while providing a clear overview of their task management through a dynamic task counter.

Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Enhance Web Development Skills: Students will practice and improve their skills in HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Understand DOM Manipulation: The project emphasizes the importance of manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript to create a dynamic user experience.
Implement User Interaction: By allowing users to add, complete, and delete tasks, students will learn how to handle user input and events effectively.
Functional Requirements
The application includes several key functionalities:

Adding Tasks: Users can input a task into a text field and click an "Add" button to append the task to the list. Each task is displayed as a list item with a checkbox and a delete button.
Marking Tasks as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking a checkbox next to each task. Completed tasks are visually distinguished with a strikethrough effect, enhancing the user experience.
Deleting Tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking a delete button next to each task, allowing for easy management of their to-do items.
Task Counter: The application dynamically displays the total number of tasks and the number of remaining (unchecked) tasks, providing users with a clear overview of their task management.
Technical Specifications
HTML Structure: The application is structured using HTML, which includes:

An input field for entering new tasks.
An "Add" button to submit tasks.
An unordered list (<ul>) to display the tasks.
A section to show the task counter.
CSS Styling: The application is styled using CSS to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Key styling features include:

A background image that covers the entire page.
Hover effects for buttons to enhance interactivity.
Distinct visual styles for completed tasks, ensuring they are easily recognizable.
JavaScript Functionality: The application utilizes JavaScript for:

DOM manipulation to add, update, and delete tasks.
Event listeners to handle user interactions, such as button clicks and checkbox changes.
Dynamic updates to the task counter based on user actions.
User Interface Layout
The user interface is designed to be intuitive and straightforward:

Header: Displays the title "My To-Do List" prominently at the top of the page.
Input Section: Contains an input field for task entry and an "Add" button for submitting tasks.
Task List Section: Displays the list of tasks, each with a checkbox for marking completion and a delete button for removal.
Footer Section: Shows a counter that updates in real-time to reflect the total number of tasks and the number of remaining tasks.
Additional Features
Input Validation: The application includes input validation to prevent users from adding empty tasks, ensuring that the task list remains meaningful and organized.
Code Readability: The code is structured with proper indentation and comments, making it easy to read and understand. Descriptive variable and function names are used to enhance clarity.
Conclusion
The Interactive To-Do List application is a comprehensive project that encapsulates essential web development skills. By completing this project, students will gain hands-on experience in creating a functional web application, reinforcing their understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project not only serves as a practical exercise but also provides a valuable tool for users to manage their tasks effectively. As a final deliverable, students will create a demo video showcasing the application's functionality and submit their work in a zip file format for evaluation.
